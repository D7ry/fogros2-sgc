## Local Demo 
If you want to get a taste of FogROS2 SGC without setting up the environment, just run 
```
docker compose build && docker compose up 
```
with docker([install](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)) and docker compose([install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)). 
It takes some time to build. You will see two docker containers running `talker` and `listener` are connected by FogROS2-SGC.

## Build FogROS2 SGC 
The following are instructions of building FogROS2 SGC. 

### Install dependencies 
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential curl pkg-config libssl-dev protobuf-compiler clang
```

#### Install Rust 
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -y
```
and run 
```
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```
to configure the environment variables. 

#### Install ROS 
ROS2 ~Dashing~ ~Eloquent~ Foxy Galactic Humble Rolling should work fine with FogROS2 SGC. 

Here we show the instruction of installing ROS2 rolling with Debian packages. 

First, install ROS2 from binaries with [these instructions](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html).

Setup your environment with [these instructions](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html#environment-setup).

Every terminal should be configured with 
```
source /opt/ros/rolling/setup.bash
````

#### Build the repo 

The repo is built with 
```
cargo build
```

## Run with Different Machines
In the example, we use two machines to show talker(machine A) and listener(machine B) example. 

#### Certificate Generation
The certificates can be generated by 
```
cd scripts
./generate_crypto.sh
```
Every directory in `./scripts/crypto` contains the cryptographic secrets needed for communication. Simply distribute the directory by copying it to `./scripts/crypto` from machine A and machine B.

#### Run with Environment Variables 
On the machine A
```
export SGC_CONFIG=talker.toml
cargo run 
```
On the machine B
```
export SGC_CONFIG=listener.toml
export GATEWAY_IP=MACHINE_A_IP
cargo run 
```
Replace `MACHINE_A_IP` with the IP address of Machine A. Note that A and B can configure with some intermediate machine C if they are not able to directly connect. Then configure `GATEWAY_IP` on both machines with machine C's ip address. The talker and listener toml configuration file can be found [here](./src/resources/README.md).


To disable the logs and run the benchmark, run with `release` option by 
```
cargo run --release
```

#### Run ROS2 talker and listener
Now run talker and listener on ROS2. 
```
# Machine A: 
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
```
and 
```
# Machine B
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener
```

### TODOs and Known issues 
1. automatic topic discovery
2. segmentation fault / node creation failure: not caused by our project but our underlying framework or ROS rcl itself. Restart the program and the problem should be fixed. The hypothesis is asynchronous error when the nodes are created too fast in parallel.
